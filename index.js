    "Adriana Mallozzi was born with cerebral palsy, and has for decades been finding ways to make technology meet her own and other’s expressiveness. She approached us at the MIT Accessibility Technology Hackathon with an idea for a better kind of sip-puff joystick. Since then we have been working with her and Easter Seals Massachusetts on “Puffin”, a sip-puff joystick that is affordable, portable, configurable, and durable.",

    "Many people with physical disabilities cannot access computers because conventional interfaces (mice, keyboards, touch screens) require fast and accurate hand motions. Assistive technology companies sell some alternatives to mice, such as desk-mounted “sip-puff joysticks” that can be moved with the mouth and “clicked” by sipping or puffing into them. However, what’s currently on the market has problems from both an engineering perspective (being quite expensive and fragile), and from a design perspective (being neither portable nor configurable).",

    "The Puffin represents a different design philosophy than what is currently on the market: we are making assistive technology that fits itself to the user, instead of the other way around. The Puffin’s goal is to work in every place and way that its users do, providing them with the same level of access to computers and smartphones that many take for granted.",

  "It’s been a delight to work on so far. The materials for our hackathon prototype cost less than $200, while the primary alternatives Jouse and Quadjoy cost $1300 and $800, respectively. Our current prototype works on one charge for days, while the Jouse and Quadjoy need to be plugged in at all times. Puffin is also waterproof, contains a fully configurable positioning and mounting system usable from a bed to a wheelchair to an airplane seat, and it folds into a shoulder bag for transport. Additionally, users can play a calibration game that sets the device’s sensitivities to match their own abilities. If our goal was to make a device for Adriana, we’d be more than satisfied: after we won the hackathon she used Puffin to take a selfie of the team from her smartphone.",

  "But we want a broader impact. We want to make something smaller, cheaper, and more configurable. We want to test Puffins with more people, so we can make something that we know is useful in a variety of situations. We want to see how far the Puffin design philosophy can go, in making interfaces that respect people’s abilities instead of highlighting their disabilities. We think this approach will work for everyone, even outside those differences commonly labeled as “disabilities”.",

  "To do this, we’ll need to design and build more prototypes. We’ll need to test them with many people for short periods of time, and a few people for long periods of time. We’ll need to join and listen to the communities that we think could use Puffin best.",

  "And to do all that, we’ll need money. Mostly we need it to buy parts, but we also need some for thank-yous for our testers and some for demonstration materials (photos, videos, interviews). Over this spring and the summer, we plan to make six or more Puffins and get them into the lives of people who will use them daily, all for less than the price of two Jouses and done as we continue to improve the product.",
